# 100DaysOfSwiftUI: Day 92-94

## Project 18: Layout and Geometry
In this technique project we’re going to explore how SwiftUI handles layout. Some of these things have been explained a little already, some of them you might have figured out yourself, but many more are things you might just have taken for granted to this point, so I hope a detailed exploration will really shed some light on how SwiftUI works.

Along the way you’ll also learn about creating more advanced layout alignments, building special effects using GeometryReader, and more – some real power features that I know you’ll be keen to deploy in your own apps.
