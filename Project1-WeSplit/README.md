# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
## Project 1: WeSplit - days 16 to 18
Build a check-splitting app. Enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

In this project you learn about the basic structure of SwiftUI apps, how to build forms and sections, creating navigation views and navigation bar titles, how to store program state with the ``@State`` property wrapper, how to create user interface controls like ``TextField`` and ``Picker``, and how to create views in a loop using ``ForEach``. Even better, you have a real project to show off for your efforts.

## Challenges

1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”

2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.

3. Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.

## Further Challenges
### Day 24 Challenge 2
Use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.
