# 100DaysOfSwiftUI

## Project 10: Cupcake Corner - day 48

In this project we’re going to build a multi-screen app for ordering cupcakes. This will use a couple of forms, which are old news for you, but you’re also going to learn how to make classes conform to `Codable` when they have `@Published` properties, how to send and receive data from the internet, how to validate forms, and more.

As we continue to dig deeper and deeper into `Codable`, I hope you’ll continue to be impressed by how flexible and safe it is. In particular, I’d like you to keep in mind how very different it is from the much older `UserDefaults` API – it’s so nice not having to worry about typing strings exactly correctly!
