## Project 7: iExpense Day 36, 37 and 38
In this project we’re going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you’re going to need to learn how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.

- Delete rows from a list

- Save and load user data

…and more.

## Challenges

1. Add an Edit/Done button to ContentView so users can delete rows more easily.

2. Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.

3. Add some validation to the Save button in AddView. If you enter “fish” or another thing that can’t be converted to an integer, show an alert telling users what the problem is.
