## Project 7: iExpense Day 36
In this project we’re going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you’re going to need to learn how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.

- Delete rows from a list

- Save and load user data

…and more.
