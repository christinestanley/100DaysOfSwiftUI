## Project 3: Views and Modifiers - days 23 and 24
In this technique project we’re going to take a close look at views and view modifiers, and hopefully answer some of the most common questions folks have at this point – why does SwiftUI use structs for its views? Why does it use some `View` so much? How do modifiers really work? My hope is that by the end of this project you’ll have a thorough understanding of what makes SwiftUI tick.

1. Create a custom `ViewModifier` (and accompanying `View` extension) that makes a view have a large, blue font suitable for prominent titles in a view.

2. Go back to project 1 and use a conditional modifier to change the total amount text view to red if the user selects a 0% tip.

3. Go back to project 2 and create a `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
