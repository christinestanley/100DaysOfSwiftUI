# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
## Project 3: Views and Modifiers - days 23...
In this technique project we’re going to take a close look at views and view modifiers, and hopefully answer some of the most common questions folks have at this point – why does SwiftUI use structs for its views? Why does it use some `View` so much? How do modifiers really work? My hope is that by the end of this project you’ll have a thorough understanding of what makes SwiftUI tick.
