## Challenge 2: Rock Paper Scissors - day 25
Make a brain training game that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

So, very roughly:

* Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
* Each turn the app will either prompt the player to win or lose.
* The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
* If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
* The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
* So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.
