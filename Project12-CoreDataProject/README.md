# 100DaysOfSwiftUI: Day 57, 58, 59

## Project 12: CoreDataProject
This technique project is going to explore Core Data in more detail, starting with a summary of some basic techniques then building up to tackling some more complex problems.

I combined the example code into a single app using country and ski resort entities.

## Topics Covered

- Why does \.self work for ForEach?

- Creating NSManagedObject subclasses

- Conditional saving of NSManagedObjectContext

- Ensuring Core Data objects are unique using constraints

- Filtering @FetchRequest using NSPredicate

- Dynamically filtering @FetchRequest with SwiftUI

- One-to-many relationships with Core Data, SwiftUI, and @FetchRequest

## Challenges

1. Make it accept an array of `NSSortDescriptor` objects to get used in its fetch request.

2. Make it accept a string parameter that controls which predicate is applied. You can use Swiftâ€™s string interpolation to place this in the predicate.

3. Modify the predicate string parameter to be an enum such as `.beginsWith`, then make that enum get resolved to a string inside the initialiser.
