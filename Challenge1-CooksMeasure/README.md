## Challenge 1: Cooks'Measure - days 19
Build an app that handles unit conversions: users will select an input unit and an output unit, then enter a value, and see the output of the conversion.

I use imperial weights for baking and as UK recipes are usually in grams I often use a converter app. So this challenge is a good opportunity to make an app tailored for use in the kitchen.

Unit conversion makes use of the `Measurement` see Hacking with Swift article [How to convert units using Unit and Measurement](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/example-code/system/how-to-convert-units-using-unit-and-measurement).
