# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
## Project 6: Animations - days 32 to 34
In this technique project we’re going to look at a range of animations and transitions with SwiftUI. Some are easy – in fact, you’ll be able to get great results almost immediately! – but some require more thinking. All will be useful, though, particularly as you work to make sure your apps are attractive and help guide the users eyes as best as you can.

Day 32 covers:
- Implicit animations
- Customising animations
- Animating bindings
- Creating explicit animations

Days 33 covers some of the more advanced techniques including:
- Controlling the animation stack
- Animating gestures
- Showing and hiding view transitions
- Building custom transitions using ViewModifier

## Challenges
Go back to the Guess the Flag project 2 and add some animation:

1. When you tap the correct flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis.

2. Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity.

3. And if you tap on the wrong flag? Well, that’s down to you – get creative!
