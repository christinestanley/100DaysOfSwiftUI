# 100DaysOfSwiftUI
## Project 2: GuessTheFlag - days 20 to 22
In this second SwiftUI project we’re going to be building a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many flags of the world.

This project is still going to be nice and easy, but gives me chance to introduce you to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.

Our first app used a completely standard iOS look and feel, but here we’re going to make something more customized so you can see how easy it is with SwiftUI.

You’re going to need to download some files for this project, which you can do from GitHub: https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift – make sure you look in the SwiftUI section of the files.

## Challenges

1. Add an @State property to store the user’s score, modify it when they get an answer right or wrong, then display it in the alert.

2. Show the player’s current score in a label directly below the flags.

3. When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert message – something like “Wrong! That’s the flag of France,” for example.

## Further Challenges
### Day 24 Challenge 3
Create a `FlagImage()` view that renders one flag image using the specific set of modifiers we had.
